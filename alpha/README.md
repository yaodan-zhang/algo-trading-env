# Alpha Library

This folder should store the production alphas (implemented by randomly chosen toy alphas in my case, though not elementary) for each asset class. Generally speaking, each asset class are expected to have different alphas, so I chose different toy alphas.

An alpha is a technical indicator calculated based on an asset's candlestick price data (open, high, low, adjusted close) over a certain time period. The alphas aim to provide insights for an asset price's behavioral during the period to signal proper automatic trading activities.
