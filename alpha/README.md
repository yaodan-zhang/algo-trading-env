# Alpha Library

Alphas (implemented by randomly chosen toy alphas) for each asset class. Generally speaking, each asset class is expected to have different alphas, so I chose different toy ones for them.

An alpha is a technical indicator calculated based on an asset's price data (open, high, low, adjusted close) over a certain time period. It aims to provide insights for an asset price's behavioral during the period to signal proper trade activities.
